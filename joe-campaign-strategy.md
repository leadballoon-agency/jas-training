# JAS Training - Facebook Campaign Strategy for Joe

## THE BIG IDEA 💡

**"Most first aid training teaches you WHAT to do. Joe teaches you HOW to do it when it matters."**

We're not selling another first aid course. We're selling the difference between freezing up and saving a life - using Joe's unique military authority and 36 years of experience that no competitor can match.

---

## THE STRATEGY 🎯

### 1. The Problem We're Exploiting
Welsh businesses have TWO problems they don't realize are connected:
- **Legal Problem:** HSE compliance, certificates, avoiding fines
- **Practical Problem:** Staff who'd panic in real emergencies

Most training only solves the first problem. Joe solves BOTH.

### 2. The Unique Angle
**Military Training Methodology** - We position Joe's military background not as a credential, but as a completely different training philosophy. Civilian instructors teach theory. Joe teaches performance under pressure.

### 3. The Campaign Flow
```

    ↓
Advertorial (Education/Story)
    ↓
Assessment (Diagnose Their Gaps)
    ↓
Thank You (Position Joe as Solution)

"After 36 years training soldiers, I discovered the one thing that separates effective emergency responders from people who freeze up completely."

Joe Sims, current Reservist Regimental Sergeant Major, has seen the difference between training that works and training that fails.

"Most civilian first aid courses teach you WHAT to do. But they completely ignore HOW to do it when your heart is racing and people are panicking."

Now he's sharing the military training principle that builds real confidence...

### 2. Authority Positioning

- Reservist Regimental Sergeant Major = active, current, relevant

### 3. Problem Agitation
- Surfaces hidden fear: "Would my staff actually cope?"
- Creates doubt about current training
- HSE fines add urgency

### 4. Dual Benefit
- Compliance (avoid fines)
- Competence (save lives)
- Only Joe offers both
